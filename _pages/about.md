Science of Science and Computational Discovery Lab (SOS+CD) is run by professor [Daniel Acu√±a](https://acuna.io/) from the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University.
  
The SOS+CD Lab works on understanding current practices in science and developing semi-automated methods to mine scientific knowledge from vast, unstructured dataset of full-text publications, citations, and images. We use a variety of computational techniques including deep learning, natural language processing, graph analytics, image processing and causal inference.
