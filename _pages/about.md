Science of Science and Computational Discovery Lab (SOS+CD) is run by professor [Daniel Acu√±a](https://acuna.io/) from the Department of Computer Science in the University of Colorado at Boulder.

The SOS+CD Lab works on understanding current practices in science and developing semi-automated methods to mine scientific knowledge from vast, unstructured datasets of full-text publications, citations, and images. We use various computational techniques, including deep learning, natural language processing, graph analytics, image processing, and causal inference.
