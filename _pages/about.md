Science of Science and Computational Discovrty Lab (SOS+CD), is a lab newly-formed by professor [Daniel Acu√±a]("https://acuna.io/").   
  
Specifically, the lab works on understanding current practices in science and developing semi-automated methods to mine scientific knowledge from vast, unstructured dataset of full-text publications, citations, and images.   
  
The SOS+CD Lab uses a variety of computational techniques including deep learning, natural language processing, graph analytics, image processing and causal inference.
