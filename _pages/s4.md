<a name="top"></a>[![image-center](/assets/images/s4/s4_wide.png){: .align-center}](#top)

Thanks to the generous funds provided by NSF's [Collaborative Research: Social Dynamics of Knowledge Transfer Through Scientific Mentorship and Publication](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1933803) grant, professors Daniel Acuna (iSchool, Syracuse University) and Stephen V. David (Oregon Health & Science University) are proud to host a Summer School on the Science of Science, or "S4".

This event will bring together PhD students, junior scholars, faculty, and experts in order to gain hands-on experience with vital Science of Science topics. We saw a need for this event when examining other summer schools and workshops -- existing events do not focus entirely on the study of SciSci and take more a methods-based approach rather than question-based. We hope to fill this gap in the Science of Science community.

S4 will be held August 3-7, 2020, at Syracuse University's School of Information Studies. We expect to have 30-40 participants for this inaugural event.
