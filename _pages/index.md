The SOS+CD Lab at the iSchool, Syracuse University works on understanding current practices in science and developing semi-automated methods to mine scientific knowledge from vast, unstructured dataset of full-text publications, citations, and images. We use a variety of computational techniques including deep learning, natural language processing, graph analytics, image processing and causal inference.
