### Postdocs

We have positions available. Please email Daniel directly with your interests at `daniel.acuna@colorado.edu` 

### Ph.D. student to start in Fall 2023 

Associate Professor Daniel Acuna from the Department of Computer Science is looking for Ph.D. students to apply to the program in Fall 2023. 

The SOS+CD Lab works on understanding current practices in science and developing semi-automated methods to mine scientific knowledge from the vast,  unstructured dataset of full-text publications, citations, and images. We use various computational techniques, including deep learning, natural language processing,  graph analytics, image processing, and causal inference. The ideal student should have a good grasp of 
 quantitative methods and be a good programmer. In addition, the ideal candidate should have an undergraduate or master's degree in  Computer Science, Engineering, Applied Statistics, Mathematics, or a similar quantitative field.
 
#### Contact me  

If you want to discuss your current career plans, are interested in our research, or are considering a Ph.D., please email me at daniel.acuna AT colorado.edu.

__For the Ph.D. program, the Deadline is December 15, but you should talk to me first__

### Masters students

Association Professor Daniel Acuna is looking for master's students.

Email daniel.acuna AT colorado.edu and attach the following information:
1. A short introduction of yourself and why you want to work with me
2. A brief CV or a 1-page resume
3. Your GitHub repository, preferably with code from a personal project rather than a “class project.”
4. Your transcripts (optional)
5. Your GRE, GMAT, or equivalent scores (optional)

#### Required qualitifications

- Develop reproducible software and tools
- Write method and result in sections for scientific manuscripts
- Have advanced computer programming skills in languages such as Python and R. SQL is also desirable

Applied Mathematics or similar quantitative fields
- Minimum of 2 years of experience coding in a major programming language such as Python, R, C, C++, or Java. 
Experience with handling big data with Apache Spark is a plus.
- Demonstrable knowledge of linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics

### Research Opportunities for Undergraduate Students  
  
The [Science of Science and Computational Discovery (SOS+CD) Lab](https://scienceofscience.org) encourages and welcomes undergraduate students to participate in exciting research projects!

The SOS+CD Lab works on understanding current practices in science and developing semi-automated methods to mine scientific knowledge from the vast, unstructured dataset of full-text publications, citations, and images.   

We use various computational techniques, including:
- Deep Learning 
- Natural Language Processing
- Graph Analytics 
- Image Processing
- Causal Inference 

We use tools like:  
- Python
- SQL
- Spark
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch

Those tools and techniques are essential for aspiring quantitative researchers, data scientists, and data analytics to have a successful career in either academia or industry. Participating in our research projects would be a great experience to get your hands dirty.
