### Ph.D. student to start in Fall 2021 

Assistant Professor Daniel Acuna from the School of Information Studies and 
the [Science of Science and Computational Discovery (SOS+CD) Lab](https://scienceofscience.org) are looking
for Ph.D. students to apply to the program in Fall 2021. 


The SOS+CD Lab works on
 understanding current practices in science and developing semi-automated methods to mine scientific knowledge from vast, 
 unstructured dataset of full-text publications, citations, and images. 
 We use various computational techniques, including deep learning, natural language processing, 
 graph analytics, image processing, and causal inference. The ideal student should have a good grasp of quantitative methods and be a good programmer. The ideal candidate should have an undergraduate major or masters degree in 
 Computer Science, Engineering, Applied Statistics, Mathematics, or a similar quantitative field.
 
#### Contact me  

If you want to discuss your current career plans, are interested in our research, are considering a Ph.D., please send me an email to 
deacuna AT syr.edu.

_Deadline to apply is January 3rd_ but you should talk to me first.

### Masters students

Assistant Professor Daniel Acuna from the School of Information Studies and the Science of Science and Computational Discovery (SOS+CD) Lab 
(https://scienceofscience.org) is looking for Master’s students with experience in image analysis, natural language processing, 
or statistical analysis. 

Send an email to deacuna AT syr.edu and attach the following information:
1. A short introduction of yourself and why you want to work with me
2. A brief CV or a 1-page resume
3. Your GitHub repository, preferably with code from a personal project rather than a “class project.”
4. Your transcripts (optional but highly desirable)
5. Your GRE, GMAT, or equivalent scores (optional but highly desirable)

#### Required qualitifications

- Develop reproducible software and tools
- Write method and result in sections for scientific manuscripts
- Have advanced computer programming skills in languages such as Python and R. SQL is also desirable
- Understand linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics
- Understand machine learning software tools and pipelines in scikit-learn, R, or Spark ML
- Understand basic concepts of software engineering

#### Job specific qualifications

- Undergraduate (for MS students) or graduate degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Applied Statistics, 
Applied Mathematics, or similar quantitative fields
- Minimum of 2 years of experience with coding in a major programming language such as Python, R, C, C++, or Java. 
Experience with handling big data with Apache Spark is a plus.
- Demonstrable knowledge of linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics

### Research Opportunities for Undergraduate Students  
  
The [Science of Science and Computational Discovery (SOS+CD) Lab](https://scienceofscience.org) encourages and welcomes undergraduate students to participate in  exciting research projects!

The SOS+CD Lab works on understanding current practices in science and developing semi-automated methods to mine scientific knowledge from vast, unstructured dataset of full-text publications, citations, and images.   

We use various computational techniques, including:
- Deep Learning 
- Natural Language Processing
- Graph Analytics 
- Image Processing
- Causal Inference 

We use tools like:  
- Python
- SQL
- Spark
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch

Those tools and techniques are important for aspiring quantitative researchers, data scientists and data analytics to have a successful career in either academia or industry.  Participating in our research projects would be a great experience to get your hands dirty.
