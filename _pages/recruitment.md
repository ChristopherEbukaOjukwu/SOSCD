### Ph.D. student to start in Fall 2024 

Associate Professor Daniel Acuna from the Department of Computer Science is looking for Ph.D. students to apply to the program in Fall 2023.

The SOS+CD Lab works on understanding current practices in science and developing semi-automated methods to mine scientific knowledge from the vast,  unstructured dataset of full-text publications, citations, and images. We use various computational techniques, including deep learning, natural language processing,  graph analytics, image processing, and causal inference. The ideal student should have a good grasp of 
 quantitative methods and be a good programmer. In addition, the ideal candidate should have an undergraduate or master's degree in  Computer Science, Engineering, Applied Statistics, Mathematics, or a similar quantitative field.
 

#### About our Ph.D.

We have a fully-funded Ph.D. program in [Computer Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/). I can also co-advise students in the [Department of Information Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/infoscience), where students are also fully funded.

__The deadline for applying is December 15__
